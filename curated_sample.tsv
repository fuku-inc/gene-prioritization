SLC4A1	Solute Carrier Family 4 Member 1 (Diego Blood Group)	"The SLC4A1 gene drives the formation of an anion exchanger that modulates intracellular and extracellular pH by orchestrating the exchange of chloride, bicarbonate, and carbonate anions across the cell membrane, an integral process affected in conditions such as hereditary spherocytosis. "	"SLC4A1 is highly expressed in erythroid cells, where it maintains pH balance and facilitates oxygen transport. Mutations in SLC4A1 can lead to hereditary spherocytosis. 18940465"	11826292		SLC4A1 has clinical relevance as a biomarker for hereditary spherocytosis and as a therapeutic target in sickle cell disease and other red blood cell disorders. 	16227998		"SLC4A1, due to its crucial function in red blood cell physiology and its link to hereditary spherocytosis, may serve as a potential blood transcriptional biomarker for this condition.

CA1	Carbonic Anhydrase 1	"The CA1 gene directs the production of carbonic anhydrase 1, a cytosolic enzyme that helps maintain tissue and blood pH balance by aiding the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into bicarbonate and protons, primarily in red blood cells. "	CA1 is strongly associated with erythroid cells due to its high expression in red blood cells and role in maintaining their pH balance. 	10747205		"CA1, although not broadly used as a biomarker, has its alterations associated with conditions such as renal carcinoma and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), hence it can be utilized as a biomarker for these conditions and erythrocytic disorders albeit with limitations.
