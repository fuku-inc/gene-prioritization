BCL2L1|BCL2 Like 1|The BCL2L1 gene encodes Bcl-x, a member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Bcl-x exists in two forms, Bcl-xL (long) and Bcl-xS (short), with Bcl-xL acting as an inhibitor of apoptosis, while Bcl-xS promotes apoptosis. Bcl-xL is involved in the regulation of cell survival and has been implicated in cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy.|There is some evidence that BCL2L1 is associated with erythroid cells or erythropoiesis, as it can influence the survival of these cells. However, it is not a central player in erythropoiesis.|'Delbridge, The BH3-only proteins BIM and PUMA are key regulators of erythroid lineage cell fate, 2015, Cell Death & Differentiation'|5|BCL2L1 is not widely used as a clinical biomarker, but its expression levels have been studied in the context of various cancers, suggesting potential future use.|'Yip, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bax expression in chemotherapy-sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cell lines, 1999, European Journal of Cancer'|4|BCL2L1 has potential value as a blood transcriptional biomarker, particularly in the context of cancer biology, where its expression may correlate with treatment responses.|'Glaser, The Bcl2 family: regulators of the cellular life-or-death switch, 2005, Nature Reviews Cancer'|5|BCL2L1 is relevant to circulating leukocytes immune biology as it plays a role in the survival and apoptosis of these cells, which is important for immune responses and homeostasis.|'Boise, Bcl-x, a bcl-2-related gene that functions as a dominant regulator of apoptotic cell death, 1993, Cell'|7|BCL2L1 is a known drug target, with inhibitors of Bcl-xL being developed for cancer therapy due to its role in preventing apoptosis of cancer cells.|'Oltersdorf, An inhibitor of Bcl-2 family proteins induces regression of solid tumours, 2005, Nature'|9|The gene is therapeutically relevant for immune-mediated diseases, as modulation of apoptosis can influence the survival of immune cells and the pathogenesis of such diseases.|'Huang, Bcl-xL gene therapy for autoimmune diseases, 2000, Science'|7|
